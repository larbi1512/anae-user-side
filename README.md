# React + TypeScript + Vite
# User Side Application

This project is a user-side application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It provides an interactive interface for users to interact with an AI-powered backend system. The application features a chatbot, activity proposal form, and enhanced search capabilities—all designed to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Chatbot Interaction**  
  Users can ask questions and receive real-time responses from the backend AI system.

- **Mini and Full-Screen Chatbot**  
  - **Mini Chatbot:** A compact, toggleable widget for quick access.
  - **Full-Screen Chatbot:** An expanded view that offers a richer conversation interface.

- **Propose Activity Form**  
  Users can propose new activities via a dedicated form. The AI model processes submissions by:
  - Checking for similarity and redundancy against existing activities.
  - Notifying the user if a similar activity is found.
  - Allowing logged-in users to add the existing activity directly to their profile.

- **AI Integration in Search Activity Fields**  
  When creating a new account, users are prompted to select five activities for their profile. The search functionality leverages semantic search with word embeddings, moving beyond simple letter-by-letter lookup to interpret the meaning of user input. This results in more accurate and relevant search results.

- **Integration with Back-End**  
  All user interactions—including chatbot queries and activity proposals—communicate with a centralized API. This ensures real-time synchronization between the user interface and the administrative dashboard, with updates fetched dynamically without a full page refresh.
